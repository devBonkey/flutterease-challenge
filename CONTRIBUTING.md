## Submitting a solution

This section guides through submitting a solution to a challenge. **How it works**

1. Navigate through the `challenges` folder and pick a problem to tackle. Each problem consist of a sub folder inside the `challenges` folder.

   The challenge folder is named following this format: `XXXX-problem_name`, where `XXXX` is the number of the recent problem.

2. Dive in and start working on it.
3. Once you've crafted your solution, contribute to repo by adding the GitHub link to `submissions.md` under `challenges/XXXX-problem_name/submissions.md`.

   You can also add links to your social medias posts for the challenge.


## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the challenge, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/martinoyovo/flutterease-challenge/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/martinoyovo/flutterease-challenge/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most participants. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation.
>

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/martinoyovo/flutterease-challenge/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an Issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
